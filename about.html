									<h1>My Story</h1>
									<p>
									I am a freelance video editor, designer, and junior developer. I have worked on corporate, non-profit, commercial and wedding videos. I started out as a prepress technician and worked for various print houses and InfoWorld Magazine. While working for InfoWorld, I developed an interest in web design. After a few months of self-study, I was asked to train the prepress department in creating web pages as InfoWorld made the transition from paper to the web.
									</p>

									<p>
									My web experience later brought me to Sun Microsystems, where I was a web designer for java.sun.com. The pinnacle of that experience was when, after working only a few months, I was asked to design the website for the annual JavaOne conference in San Francisco and later for the conference in Japan. I continued to design the sites for three years until most design responsibilities were contracted to an outside company. A company-wide reduction in force brought an end to my job at Sun. But I was already looking into going back to school. I have a B/A in art from San Jose State University, but I wanted to give the film industry a try. I decided to study film and video production at De Anza College.
									</p>

									<p>
									Eventually, I got a position as an associate editor with Transvideo Studios. Transvideo was a preferred vendor for Google and I cut my editorial teeth on projects for Google. I also helped in the development of new workflows, training new hires, creating encoding workflows, and writing training documentation.
									</p>

									<p>
									As a web professional I've focused on developing more front end skills. This year I completed an intense, full-time, 12 week, project-based, front end web development immersive at RockIt Bootcamp in Phoenix, AZ, where I acquired many new full stack skills in addition to updating HTML and CSS. These skills include JavaScript/jQuery, AJAX, JSON, PHP, MySQL, MVC (Laravel), and github along with Agile methodologies.
									</p>

									<p>
									I work hard to craft a clean and coherent narrative and look forward to creating work that engages, entertains, educates, and inspires.
